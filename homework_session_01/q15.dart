// What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it impact the way variables are used?

// it means that once a variable's type is set it can only hold values of that type and compiler will check for type mismatches before running the code

// Static typing in Dart means you need to be deliberate with variable types, which leads to safer, more maintainable, and optimized code. It ensures that variables are used consistently, offers early error detection, and provides tools with the information needed for helpful features like autocompletion and error highlighting.
